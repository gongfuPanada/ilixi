What is ilixi?
==============
ilixi is an open-source lightweight GUI framework and it is 
designed with Linux based embedded devices in mind. ilixi 
uses DirectFB at its core in order to render all graphics 
content to a Linux framebuffer device. This eliminates the 
need for X server. Although DirectFB provides basic 
raster graphics functionality, Cairo and Pango are used for 
rendering 2D graphics and laying out text respectively.

Build instructions
==================
This section briefly describes the steps for building ilixi only. 
For information on building dependencies please refer to ilixi 
web site (http://www.ilixi.org).

Note that DirectFB should be compiled with multi application core 
support. 

Once all dependencies are successfully installed on your system 
you could build and install ilixi as follows:

	./configure
	make
	make install

Ilixi uses Doxygen for documentation. If your system has required software, you could generate an up-to-date html documentation as follows:

	./configure
	make doxygen-doc
