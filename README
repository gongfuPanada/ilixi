What is ilixi?
==============
Ilixi is an open-source lightweight GUI framework and it is 
designed with linux based embedded devices in mind. Ilixi 
uses DirectFB at its core in order to render all graphics 
content to a linux framebuffer device. This eliminates the 
need for the X server. Although DirectFB provides basic 
raster graphics functionality, Cairo and Pango are used for 
rendering 2D graphics and text respectively.

Build instructions
==================
This section briefly describes the steps for building ilixi. 
DirectFB should be compiled with multi application core support. 
For information on building dependencies please refer to ilixi 
web site (http://www.ilixi.org).

Once all dependencies are successfully installed on your system 
you could build and install ilixi as follows:

	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

Ilixi uses Doxygen for generating its documentation from source files. 
If your system supports it, you could generate an up-to-date html 
documentation as follows:

	./configure
	make doxygen-doc
